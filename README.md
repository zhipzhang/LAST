# LAST Version0.1(LACT Analysis Science Tool)
LAST is a project designed for Large Array of Imaging Atmospheric cherenkov telescope. It will includes the conversion of [EventIO](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/~bernlohr/sim_telarray/Documentation/eventio_en.pdf) file and  different data level generation.

In LAST, C++ is used to do the computational jobs, mostly in the production of the Data Level File(ROOT-format), because at this time root is the simplest format to be handled via xrootd.

Data Levels and Analysis is adapted from ctapipe.
